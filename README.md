In fact, I do not want to learn ML or DL, as I think they are so unreal for me. I'd like to learn and do something practical, at least they can have instant impacts on me.
But, as a postgraduate student, I have to learn these.

被迫学机器学习 or 深度学习，目前还不知道这对除了对我拿到硕士学位之外还有没有其他好处，作为一个学生&&电脑还是i5 8代的标压且MX150的显卡，学校也没配服务器，学这属实硬件不够。

希望我能够在学习过程中对这些个东西感兴趣吧！
